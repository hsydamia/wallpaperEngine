Recommended|I have always hesitated to use live wallpaper applications since they used to be very performance-draining. When researching for perfomance-tests of "Wallpaper Engine" I didn't quite find a review that was useful for me so i decided to get the software and test it myself. It should be noted that this review will ignore other apsects such as the content of the software.Hardware Specs: CPU...............................i5 6400 (no overclock with BCLK)CPU cooler......................AIO watercooling loop from NZXTGPU...............................GTX 980TI (MSI - no manual overclock)RAM...............................16GB DDR4 (GSkill - 2133MHz - dual kit)Motherboard.....................ASUS ROG Maximus VIII RangerSSD................................Samsung 850 Evo (Only for OS, Steam and apps on HDD)OS..................................Windows 10 ProfessionalTest: The software (run in non 64-bit mode) will be tested in two scenarios. Arsenal wallpaper will be used for all tests.1) Hardware usage will be observed while the System sits idle for 10 minutes without any other applications running in the background. The tool for HW monitoring is "OpenHardwareMonitor". This testing scenario will be repeated for the wallpaper presets Low, Medium and High and a standard windows desktop background as reference. CPU temperature CPU load GPU temperature GPU load GPU memory usage Preset None Low Medium High CPUTempAvg 21°C 20°C 20°C 20°C CPUTempMin 18°C 18°C 18°C 18°C CPUTempMax 25°C 22°C 22°C 23°C CPULoadAvg 1% 3% 3% 3% CPULoadMin 0.4% 0.4% 0.1% 0.4% CPULoadMax 24% 10% 24% 24% GPULoadAvg 0.1% 7% 10% 15% GPULoadMin 0.1% 1% 1% 2% GPULoadMax 5% 11% 16% 21% GPUTempAvg 35°C 36°C 37°C 37°C GPUTempMin 34°C 35°C 36°C 36°C GPUTempMax 36°C 37°C 38°C 38°C GPUMemoryUse 180MB 185MB 230MB 260MB Furthermore the RAM usage has been tested, but did not show measureable differences!Ram usage was always at about 2.2GB.2) This test will show the impact on gaming performance. Again, Arsenal wallpaper is used, this time on preset High. As there are different options to choose, which define how the wallpaper will react to an application being run in fullscreen (Keep Running, Stop, Pause) a benchmark will be done for every mode and as reference with a standard windows desktop background.I chose the Benchmark Scene from Rainbow Six Siege with the graphics on ultra preset. Here are the results: FPS in RB6-Benchmark RB6S MinFPS AvgFPS MaxFPS None 102 173 327 Stop 93 172 264 Pause 100 172 296 Keep Running 58 171 299 Conclusion: As we have been able to see, there are slight differences in terms of hardware usage. I was surprised that the software did much better than expected, but the results may differ, considering community-made wallpapers may use more resources. The CPU temperature values may not be very reliable due to the CPU being watercooled thus these values are at the very low end of the scale. Wallpaper Engine does also have an impact on gaming performance, which can be kept to a minimum using the "Pause" or "Stop" behaviour for fullscreen applications.With a hardware config as "enthusiast" as mine, i doubt that there will be serious performance issues with this application, but if you are gaming on a much weaker rig, i recommend turning down the settings of the live wallpapers a bit. At the end of the day, you will have to decide yourself wether you want to sacrifice resources for cool a$$ (a$$ can be taken literally) wallpapers or not.I do not regret my 4 bucks on this software and will be using it from now on.|11 March 2017

Recommended|TL;DR: Hardware Friendly (read below for more info,TL;DR the bold texts)Get this app ASAP!First Note:Please press read more! This review is very long that you can't just read first note, considerations below!Oh, i will only state things that important to read after reading official description.They already explain a lot, this is extended info and considerations. (As comparison i add Stardock Deskscape 8 as competitor, popular in the past, expensive)Pros: + Less resource use and taken than Stardock Deskscape 8 (Wallpaper Engine [6-15MB] vs DeskScape 8 [35 MB]) + Supports Unity applications, Gifs, 3D render and HTMLs, beside video formats mentioned above, tested in my old ASUS X550ZE laptop or in I3 GMA 3000 4GB RAM(Stardock Deskscape 8 doesn't support apps, dunno about gif and html support) + Full control of the software: FPS Limiter, Reflection, PostFX, High Priority, Render Resolution (power of two) Auto Start on Windows Launch (Stardock Deskcape 8 has less options) + Playing HD or FHD or even UHD (maybe the program rescale) video smoothly in Max setting 60 FPS my ASUS X550ZE laptop (spec: A10 quadcore 4 threads @2.5ghz, boost to 3.40 Ghz, usually reach 3.0Ghz, R6 APU 1GB + R5 M230 GPU 2GB, RAM, DDR3 1600Mhz 2x4GB, OS: Windows 10 Pro). (Stardock Deskscape 8 will lag with 4k videos) + There's multi monitor support. You can use different background for different monitor, but sometimes buggy that monitor not detected, workaround is exit the engine and try again (killing all the engine apps). (Stardock has only 1 wallpaper output, even you have multi monitors) + Playing FHD videos (due Windows 7 and APU limit), sheep app (testing app) and htmls in 20-30 fps just fine in i3 intel GMA 3000 4GB RAM (Much more weaker than minimum spec) old tweaked Toshiba Satellite Windows 7 laptop (removed background apps, minimize aero effects)It is fully compatible with i3 and GMA 3000 with 4GB of RAM or so as long you got smart to manage > Hardware Friendly (Trust me, Stardock Deskscape 8 is much heavier, i used it) + There's Wallpaper Creator and Workshop, which means you got access to 1000+ pages of them, which is so many. (In Stardock Deskscape 8 you suggested to buy videos, and obviously no workshops) + There's Pause and AutoClose feature, that make your PC performance doesn't degrade at all when you doing something, example playing games, but can also trigger pause when not gaming. > Without this feature, then your PC will slower when playing games, A recently posted review says this lagged his terraria, forget to turn this on, zzz. > Extending from performance tab from official description (Stardock Deskscape 8? Autopause, not AutoClose that frees more RAM) + TRADING CARDS!!! Achievements too! (Of Course Stardock doesn't have these XDDD)Cons: - This didn't support OS that is outside of Windows 7,8,10, including Mac OS. (I don't sure if stardock deskscape 8 support Mac OS because i did not tested stardock in Mac)- Some antivirus may conflict. Sample AVG.Personal note: * Still in "Early Access" and going to improve * Paid the full price (of early access 7 December 2016, prob still initial release), and regret nothing.Rating: 93/100I will try to keep this review up to dateLast Words:This is the end of review.

Recommended|All right so here's what I went thru: - Okay man, it's time I bought this thing.- I mean all these people giving positive reviews and the general review average being overwhelmingly ♥♥♥♥ing positive must mean something, right? I've waited too long. Let's find out.*Purchases software- Where the ♥♥♥♥ is this oh it's under software. *facepalms- All right, it's installed. Let's check this out.- I've heard some bad things about there being a lot of anime tiddies in the workshop bu-*sees galaxy wallpaper- Whoa. That is a nice wallpaper. How does it work, do I just click it?- 200mb? Wtf?*Downloads wallpaper*sees moving wallpaper for the first time in his life*0_0- Duuuuude. That is SO SICK. THERE IS A ♥♥♥♥ING SPINNING GALAXY ON MY DESKTOP NOW MAN.* erratically moves on to different wallpapers- Wait what is that. I want that. That too. Is that moving too? Holy ♥♥♥♥ I want that.- What is that.*applies- WHOA. NICE, Abstract, mountain, view... thing. I dunno wtf that is.*switches to different wallpaper- Hey man look at this, that is so cool!! It's like a- a, uh a- a- a thing. A colorful waterfall blackhole bluehole thing.*sees something else that he wants to download*- WhoaaAA what is that? That is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing man !!! I need dis.*sees something else- I need dis.- Dis too.click click click- Holy crap !!!!- DUDE THAT NEEDS TO BE ON MY DESKTOP, I DON'T KNOW WHY THOUGH.*sees something- OH MY ♥♥♥♥ING GOD* has heart attack_______First of all, don't pay attention to bad reviews that focus on there being a lot of tiddies in the workshop, because you can just filter that sh*t out. I mean unless you don't know how to use a computer? But since you are here, looking for moving wallpapers, I assume you know how to do that. Okay so moving on now that you know how to use a computer.Even though if you don't feel the exact emotions that I portrayed above (because I am known to exaggerate reactions of people including myself), you will still definitely have a "Whoaa, that is so cool!" moment. Like, many many times. Even if you have experienced moving wallpapers before.And even after you purchase this software, use it for a couple months and get used to the concept of moving wallpapers, you will then transform your interest into different things. Like, you will start creating your own stuff. Hell there are even achievements to get in this app.I have only 2 softwares purchased from Steam. And they are both ♥♥♥♥ing gold. One of them is this. I am 100% supportive of this app, and all the revenue it makes is completely deserved. The guy (or girl?) who made this, is a ♥♥♥♥ing genius.This is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.U NEED DIS|28 September 2017

It's certainly neat, and well worth the price alone when it's not even on sale!This Software is very, very, very easy to use and create Wallpapers to publish on the Steam Workshop!Speaking of Steam Workshop, you don't have to create your own wallpaper, you can also browse the Workshop to whatever you would like! You got your Anime of course, Cars, Cartoon, meme's, etc. The possibilities are endless.I would recommend this to anyone who wants to spice up their life with a Wallpaper that moves and plays sounds!Just make sure your parents aren't around to find out how disappointing you are with HD 2d Anime Women dancing as a your Wallpaper.|22 February

Recommended|I purchased this software hoping it would return the same functionality Dream Scene (Live Wallaper) did in Windows Vista that was later removed for performance issues. The truth is this software is what Dream Scene should have been and is far more complex and configurable then the official feature ever was. I did a full review of this software at http://barnnerd.com that will be published on 3/9/2017 at 6AM PST.I am in no way affiliated with the company that makes this program and purchased the program for full price from Steam after discovering it. I would however love it if the author of this program contacted me as I would love to speak to him/her about some other features moving forward since I come from a software development background myself.Thank you,Jerry Berg (aka.

Recommended|Wallpaper EngineSo my first impression from the Title itself was rather mhh lets say "interesting" so I watched the Trailers which Steam had to offer.The Trailers actually just show a little part of whats possible in this! Its a really really amazing Eninge and I dont see the money I've spent as wasted, no it was worth the money and since there is a Workshop for it and lots of talented people uploading their work in its even better!There are a few issues with the Audiodetecting Wallpapers since when I use my Razer Kraken Chroma 7.1 it only detects the sound from my Microphone basicly what I say but not the music, without it works perfectly, but this is the only thing which bugs me sometimes, maybe I just need to change some options and it'll be fine.Anyways, I really think this is a great Engine worth to buy!Its such a simple idea.. yet its so briliant, really I hope to see more content for Wallpaper Engine and I think it has a long way to go but in that time I wont leave it I will join and see where it will go to.My rating is 10/10 Looking forward to more~|10 May 2017

Recommended|Pretty neat tool. I was able to create some decent active wallpapers with Clickteam Fusion before, but this little piece of software makes it a lot easier. Plus that it has a workshop and a ton of wallpapers you can download. Only minor negative thing atm is that the workshop is more or less spammed with anime and Japanese stuff, but there are still some other nice wallpapers on the workshop if you dig through the list. If you are a fan of anime and are japanese, then I guess this would actually be a positive thing :)|31 March 2017

Recommended|I never knew you could do so much with a wallpaper, especially with no performance loss. This software is essential and I cannot imagine using my PC without it. But be warned, Wallpaper Engine is flooded with anime and ecchi. Not a bad thing at all, but it can be overwhelming. Just turn off the "anime" tag.|29 April
Recommended|Never have I ever felt so satisfied off a purchase I made. With tools to construct your own live wallpapers, options to customize adding sound effects/audio,color schemes to select, settings to maintain fluidity (60fps max), controls for CPU and RAM usage, full support of Steam workshop, (variety ranging from audio enabled, interactive and resolutions upto 4k)the ability to add your own custom video clips / gifs, achievements and trading cards to collect,this is the best thing out there that is worth every penny of the price you pay for it.If you are concerned about your in-game fps or the tampering of the performance of your heavy software, mind you, that you can select in preferences to pause your live wallpaper when another program is maximized over the desktop or that which is in focus.I could only wonder where this had been all my life? This is way better than any of the other live wallpaper softwares I've used, such as Stardock Deskscapes 8 where you had to pay more than this product's price for its yearly subscription having features and content no where near what this offers.I whole heartedly recommend this.|23 December 2016
Recommended|By far this is the best software you can get for only $4.It completely delivers what it promises: Live wallpapers for your pc. And it's flawless!You can choose from a large number of wallpapers created by users in the workshop and use it as your own. The program itself is very easy and intuitive to use: Explore the workshop and select the wallpaper you want through the software.The loading time in the Windows startup is less than 5 seconds if you're using a SSD. Using a normal HD it might take up to 30 seconds.You can also create your own wallpaper to use. If you want you can publish it at the workshop so others users can download it. In general I can totally recommend this software, it will bring your desktop to life.|27 June 2017

Recommended|+ Lots of contents for your desktop backgrounds.+ Some clock and calendar widgets that are blended into the wallpaper. + Uses very little system resource to run.+ Easy to use interface, and upload large files without much hassle.+ Upload scene, video, web and application wallpaper.- Need more uploads from games and other media. Currently (4/2017) too many anime contents (3D girls dancing your typical ones) flooding the library.- The GUI feels like it's bland. A bit more upgrade on its apperance along with new options would make it appear more polished.// Tried to run it while playing another game caused the in-game sound/music from game to be muted. Could not hear the background's music or the game's music. Turning off the background's setting for audio did nothing for the game. Perhaps I am not suppose to run this while playing a game, but if that is the case (correct me if I am wrong), then the point of having it for setting up live wallpaper would mean nothing.Overall it's an amazing piece of software.

Recommended|Product received for free PROS:- Best software of its kind- Affordable- Easy to use- Beautiful- Animated (not Anime) backgrounds are the bee's knees CONS:- Story feels linear- Gameplay needs a bit of improvement- Extreme lack of character development|24 March
Recommended|Amazing addition for your desktop :)Lots of fun to play with and thousand of different wallpapers to choose from.I really enjoy using it and Im not thinking about dropping it like...ever.Most of the PCs this day should run this no problem :DPros:-Wide variety to choose from.-Simply makes your desktop look SOO much better.-Simple to use.Cons:-Users really need to stop uploading simple snowfilters on top of normal wallpapers. It's okay if they're christmas based. But I even saw summer themes with snow falling. And nothing BUT the snow was animated.-You come across tons of Anime Openings or Simple Youtube Videos. Which I don't really get. Who wants to use a Youtube Video as a Wallpaper? :I Well...I guess that's up to everyone themselfs.Overall:This is a beautiful idea and works really well :DI've been searching for something like this for several years now. And this one is super simple and easily worth the price.|10 August 2017

Recommended|Honestly astounding piece of software, I purchased this a good 3-4 months before writing this review to really show my honest opinion and all I have to say is my desktop is just not the same without it running in the background.The 'Wallpaper Engine' provides aesthetic artists or witty gamers with the option to fully customize their computers home screen (well at least the home screen/colour scheme) providing them and myself with dazzling wallpapers every time I log into my computer.You can play music videos or games at your desktop and have it play in the background on a loop or tick a option to have it pause once another program is overlaying the desktop maximized mode.Best thing is it runs automatically upon computer start up so their is no need to keep opening Steam and then running the software from your Games tab as it is already their on start up, I have had great fun with the builder and uploaded a few of my own (more for personal pleasure) but from this testing I ran the software in the background as my main concern was performance being reduced, this is not the case.The software pauses itself if selected to stopping the performance of your computer from dropping during gametime or rendering out Artworks or using heavy CPU demanding software which really surprised me.I recommend this to everyone as I was definitely off with it to begin with but I really can't love the desktop now the same without it & the price is just a steal, fantastic product and one of my personal highly recommended.|18 August 2017

Recommended|Great software to spice up your desktop. The best thing about this program is that it is Steam Workshop support so you're pretty much not going to run out of desktops to use for quite some time.You can use 2d or 3d backgrounds with effects, videos, or even applications. If you ever wanted to make your desktop something fancier than just a simple picture, than this is a great place to start.Pros+Simple to understand+Tons of options +Great support for varied resolutions and monitorsCons-You essentially have to spend time on your desktop if using one monitor to appreciateMy con aside of having to spend time in a place you don't typically spend a lot of time at this is a great program to look at getting in order to make your desktop entertaining. The convenience to switch back and forth between all these types of backgrounds is a nice enough reason to recommend this product at full price.Originally posted by Crimson-Albedo:Follow my reviews through my curator at Crim's Humble Opinion|20 March

Recommended|Product received for free What an amazing desktop wallpaper utility and an absolute bargain for the low price (£2.79 here). I had this on my wishlist for some time and was lucky to have it gifted to me by a Steam friend :)Although I have only just looked at the software for a short time, it was clear that a lot of thought and effort went into the development and you're spoilt for choice with the amount and variety of wallpapers to suit any persons likes. The 3d animated wallpapers look really good, adding that special touch to your desktop screen. There is also a good amount of categories (sci-fi, fantasy, landscape, etc.) to filter out exactly they type of wallpapers you are interested in.The setup is very simple and quick to go though. You will be up and running in less than a minute. You also have options to design your own wallpapers. Once installed, the program sits in your taskbar and can be called up easily to switch wallpapers or browse for new ones which are not supplied within the main program. I especially liked the fact that this software will run happily on a system and can even be set to run on computer startup (if you wish) so it always be on. If you don't want the program to run on PC startup, that's fine too as when closed down your desktop will revert back to your original wallpaper as though you had not run the progarm.|14 December 2017
Recommended|Wallpaper Engine is literally one of the best softwares you can have on your pc. You can get almost anything you can think of as a wallpaper (a lot of the time they are interactive too) in just about every resolution you can think of. You can get videos as your background too (such as anime openings and much more)! Are you turned off by the fact that wallpaper engine is mainly targeted by weeaboos? Don't be! There is TONS of good non-anime related wallpapers. I personally have some space wallpapers (as I'm an astronomy lover) and some game wallpapers for games such as dark souls, witcher 3, etc. If you also feel that theres not enough wallpapers to your liking then you can even make your own! Wallpaper Engine provides you some tools to help you make your own wallpapers. If you have skills in coding (which I sure as hell don't because I ain't THAT smart lol) then they can be taken full advantage of with this software! As of the date of writing this review this game is still in early access so more content plans on being added in the future. So far I havent experienced any bugs with this software but I can't speak for others. Finally, one of the best parts of this software is that it puts little to no stress on your computer's performance! I'm running on an Intel Pentium G4560 @ 3.2ghz, 8gb DDR4 ram and an EVGA GTX 1050ti (not the most top of the line computer) and I have all the settings cranked to max and it literally puts no stress on my hardware, as a matter of fact just having steam open uses more of my hardware power than Wallpaper Engine itself displaying a moving wallpaper at 1080p 60fps! This software can run on 99% of computers no problem so don't worry about having low end hardware. Wallpaper Engine also pauses when you go fullscreen on anything like webpage or a game (you can disable it if you wish). Overall this is THE BEST software I have ever used on a computer. I'd HIGHLY recommend you pick it up right now! It's only $4 and the price will be raised (according to developer) once it leaves early access so hurry and buy it ASAP!10/10 Would download hentai my favorite anime openings and game wallpapers again!TL:DR: You can get thousands of wallpapers of almost anything you can think of, as well as make and upload your own. It uses little to no power of your pc hardware and is convienent in nearly every category you might think. A must buy software for pretty much all people!|3 September 2017

Recommended|Absolutely amazing! Almost no drop in performance what so ever. The wallpapers here on the workshop are amazing (Besides the hentai and weab ones) and the music responsive ones are the greatest! This program works like magic for me because i have a broken windows 7, which means i had a solid black background for 3 years and it was dreadful. This program somehow overrides the windows error background thus, i can have a wallpaper now and some of the best ones ever made! Thanks so much to the devs, you guys are the real heroes here, only asking $4. Absolutely fantastic!|25 June 2017
Recommended|One of the best softwares you will ever find around.Create, Share and Use custom made wallpapers!They can be Animated, Videos, GIfs, Web Apps and the Simple Screenshots.You will most likely not find anything like this because:+ It is simple and easy to use.+ Contains steam workshop.+ Customizable Performance settings so you don't have any issues.+ Amazing default wallpapers made by the Developer.There isn't really a downside as it may depend on your system, but even that you can lower the settings and still have an amazing desktop wallpaper.Grab this just for 4€, there ain't anything to lose!|1 December 2016

Recommended|Enough of still pictures as background! Wallpaper Engine is here to make your desktop alive and beautiful. One of the most useful software I've ever used. This software could really help you, if you care about your pc's customization.Pluspoint is there are many beautiful wallpapers on Steam Workshop which you can download for free. So don't need to pay extra bucks to get different wallpapers. Besides you can also make wallpapers on your own creativity. ;)This is a must buy software! Belive me you won't regret it. :)|12 August 2017

Recommended|Well, this is perhaps even more amazing than I thought it would be. There are so many truly fantastic visceral audio-visual experiences awaiting, particularly in the Workshop area.That said...boy, would it be nice if you could actually block the 50% of wallpapers that are anime-based from showing up. The lack of proper tagging means even removing "anime" and "cartoon" from your selections only seems to cut it down partially. All it would take was someone spending a day or two to tag all the user-submitted content to make the Workshop area far easier to navigate.|29 June 2017
