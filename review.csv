								I have always hesitated to use live wallpaper applications since they used to be very performance-draining. When researching for perfomance-tests of "Wallpaper Engine" I didn't quite find a review that was useful for me so i decided to get the software and test it myself. It should be noted that this review will ignore other apsects such as the content of the software.Hardware Specs: CPU...............................i5 6400 (no overclock with BCLK)CPU cooler......................AIO watercooling loop from NZXTGPU...............................GTX 980TI (MSI - no manual overclock)RAM...............................16GB DDR4 (GSkill - 2133MHz - dual kit)Motherboard.....................ASUS ROG Maximus VIII RangerSSD................................Samsung 850 Evo (Only for OS Steam and apps on HDD)OS..................................Windows 10 ProfessionalTest: The software (run in non 64-bit mode) will be tested in two scenarios. Arsenal wallpaper will be used for all tests.1) Hardware usage will be observed while the System sits idle for 10 minutes without any other applications running in the background. The tool for HW monitoring is "OpenHardwareMonitor". This testing scenario will be repeated for the wallpaper presets Low Medium and High and a standard windows desktop background as reference. CPU temperature  CPU load  GPU temperature  GPU load  GPU memory usage  Preset None Low Medium High   CPUTempAvg 21°C 20°C 20°C 20°C   CPUTempMin 18°C 18°C 18°C 18°C   CPUTempMax 25°C 22°C 22°C 23°C   CPULoadAvg 1% 3% 3% 3%   CPULoadMin 0.4% 0.4% 0.1% 0.4%   CPULoadMax 24% 10% 24% 24%   GPULoadAvg 0.1% 7% 10% 15%   GPULoadMin 0.1% 1% 1% 2%   GPULoadMax 5% 11% 16% 21%   GPUTempAvg 35°C 36°C 37°C 37°C   GPUTempMin 34°C 35°C 36°C 36°C   GPUTempMax 36°C 37°C 38°C 38°C   GPUMemoryUse 180MB 185MB 230MB 260MB Furthermore the RAM usage has been tested but did not show measureable differences!Ram usage was always at about 2.2GB.2) This test will show the impact on gaming performance. Again Arsenal wallpaper is used this time on preset High. As there are different options to choose which define how the wallpaper will react to an application being run in fullscreen (Keep Running Stop Pause) a benchmark will be done for every mode and as reference with a standard windows desktop background.I chose the Benchmark Scene from Rainbow Six Siege with the graphics on ultra preset. Here are the results: FPS in RB6-Benchmark   RB6S MinFPS AvgFPS MaxFPS   None 102 173 327   Stop 93 172 264   Pause 100 172 296   Keep Running 58 171 299 Conclusion: As we have been able to see there are slight differences in terms of hardware usage. I was surprised that the software did much better than expected but the results may differ considering community-made wallpapers may use more resources. The CPU temperature values may not be very reliable due to the CPU being watercooled thus these values are at the very low end of the scale. Wallpaper Engine does also have an impact on gaming performance which can be kept to a minimum using the "Pause" or "Stop" behaviour for fullscreen applications.With a hardware config as "enthusiast" as mine i doubt that there will be serious performance issues with this application but if you are gaming on a much weaker rig i recommend turning down the settings of the live wallpapers a bit. At the end of the day you will have to decide yourself wether you want to sacrifice resources for cool a$$ (a$$ can be taken literally) wallpapers or not.I do not regret my 4 bucks on this software and will be using it from now on.

TL;DR: Hardware Friendly (read below for more infoTL;DR the bold texts)Get this app ASAP!First Note:Please press read more! This review is very long that you can't just read first note considerations below!Oh i will only state things that important to read after reading official description.They already explain a lot this is extended info and considerations. (As comparison i add Stardock Deskscape 8 as competitor popular in the past expensive)Pros: + Less resource use and taken than Stardock Deskscape 8 (Wallpaper Engine [6-15MB] vs DeskScape 8 [35 MB]) + Supports Unity applications Gifs  3D render and HTMLs beside video formats mentioned above tested in my old ASUS X550ZE laptop or in I3 GMA 3000 4GB RAM(Stardock Deskscape 8 doesn't support apps dunno about gif and html support) + Full control of the software: FPS Limiter Reflection PostFX High Priority Render Resolution (power of two) Auto Start  on Windows Launch (Stardock Deskcape 8 has less options) + Playing HD or FHD or even UHD (maybe the program rescale) video smoothly in Max setting 60 FPS my ASUS X550ZE laptop (spec: A10 quadcore 4 threads @2.5ghz boost to 3.40 Ghz usually reach 3.0Ghz R6 APU 1GB + R5 M230 GPU 2GB RAM DDR3 1600Mhz 2x4GB OS: Windows 10 Pro). (Stardock Deskscape 8 will lag with 4k videos) + There's multi monitor support. You can use different background for different monitor but sometimes buggy that monitor not detected workaround is exit the engine and try again (killing all the engine apps). (Stardock has only 1 wallpaper output even you have multi monitors) + Playing FHD videos (due Windows 7 and APU limit) sheep app (testing app) and htmls in 20-30 fps just fine in i3 intel GMA 3000 4GB RAM (Much more weaker than minimum spec) old tweaked Toshiba Satellite Windows 7 laptop (removed background apps minimize aero effects)It is fully compatible with i3 and GMA 3000 with 4GB of RAM or so as long you got smart to manage > Hardware Friendly (Trust me Stardock Deskscape 8 is much heavier i used it) + There's Wallpaper Creator and Workshop which means you got access to 1000+ pages of them which is so many. (In Stardock Deskscape 8 you suggested to buy videos and obviously no workshops) + There's Pause and AutoClose feature that make your PC performance doesn't degrade at all when you doing something example playing games but can also trigger pause when not gaming. > Without this feature then your PC will slower when playing games A recently posted review says this lagged his terraria forget to turn this on zzz. > Extending from performance tab from official description (Stardock Deskscape 8? Autopause not AutoClose that frees more RAM) + TRADING CARDS!!! Achievements too! (Of Course Stardock doesn't have these XDDD)Cons: - This didn't support OS that is outside of Windows 7810  including Mac OS. (I don't sure if stardock deskscape 8 support Mac OS because i did not tested stardock in Mac)- Some antivirus may conflict.  Sample AVG.Personal note: * Still in "Early Access" and going to improve * Paid the full price (of early access 7 December 2016 prob still initial release) and regret nothing.Rating: 93/100I will try to keep this review up to dateLast Words:This is the end of review. I know this ain't perfect because nothing in this world perfect but i will try to make it better.

								I gotta say its worth every penny but I'll tell you right now mostly like 50-70% wallpapers in the workshop are all ANIME.but still its awesome 10/10 would bang again
